									<h2>About</h2>
								</header>
								<p>After completing my biology degree at Queen’s University, I knew I wanted to branch away from academia and spend some time tapping into my creative roots. Having loved arranging garden bouquets for my mom as a little girl, I decided to try my hand at floral design. I started my flower journey at <a href="http://www.moodmossflowers.com/" target="_blank">Mood Moss Flowers</a> in Ottawa, where I spent a year working and learning as an apprentice florist.</p>
								<p>I discovered I was passionate about floral design and decided to pursue my own business when I moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia. You can now find me creating unique and beautiful arrangements in my home-based floral studio with my trusty sidekick Louie the English bulldog.</p>

										<h2>Testimonials</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Words cannot describe how incredibly grateful I am for this talented lady! She transformed my dream into a reality and made my wedding day the most dreamy day with her stunning florals. Her patience, kindness and genuine passion for what she does is what makes her so special. Jessie, thank you for everything you did for me. From arriving early to set up and going above and beyond with the arrangements, thank you! I highly recommend Jessie to all you gals and guys out there looking for the best florals around, you won’t be disappointed. - <i>Kelly</i></p>
									<p>Jessie was so lovely to work with! She’s very thorough, and can bring your vision to life even more beautifully than you imagined. She’s very detailed and so eloquently ensures you don’t miss anything that will make your day look perfect. Highly recommend her for any floral desires - weddings and beyond! Thanks again, Jessie! Was a pleasure working with you!! - <i>Shanna</i></p>
									<p>Jessie did the flowers for my wedding, and I am still in awe over her work and how beautifully it all came together. From the first meeting to discuss vision, I knew I was in good hands. She offered an expertise that put me right at ease. Jessie created a detailed plan and worked with me to ensure no detail was left out. Her skills and creativity meant that she was willing to take on challenges, too, like helping to design and assemble a green/floral wall for the ceremony backdrop. It was perfect. From bouquets, boutonnieres, centre pieces, and flower crowns, to greenery lining the aisle and railings, and thoughtful touches on signage and even the wedding cake, everything was expertly executed and looked like a dream. I highly recommend Little Thistle! - <i>Letty</i></p>
									<p>Jessie created the florals for my elopement this winter. I told Jessie to create what she wanted with whites and greens. When the florals arrived the morning of my wedding, I was amazed by what she created. My bouquet was everything I could have imagined and more. My husbands boutonnière was perfect. All of my guests couldn’t stop admiring my bouquet. The flowers were very fresh and lasted long after my wedding. I highly recommend Little Thistle Floral Design.- <i>Kait</i></p>
									<p>Jessie was a wonderful florist! We were a bit unsure about what we wanted for florals at our wedding, and sheepishly admitted as much at our first meeting with Jessie. She was unfazed by our indecision, and guided us through the process with total ease, showing us different flower options for our budget, and suggesting colour schemes and arrangements. We loved everything she created for our day! Mine and my bridesmaid’s bouquets were gorgeous. The centerpieces were so lovely that all the guests jumped at the opportunity to take one home at the end of the night. And of course, our dog loved her flower collar, even if she wouldn't pose for the photographer. We could not recommend Jessie enough. She was a pleasure to work with while planning our wedding and absolutely delivered on the day. - <i>Kathleen</i></p>
									<p>Jessie was amazing from our first meeting to all of the following emails and communication and I put my complete faith in her. She did not disappoint and I jumped up and down like a little girl when I saw my beautiful flowers! She is so wonderfully talented and it's clear that she loves what she does.- <i>Marlee</i></p>
